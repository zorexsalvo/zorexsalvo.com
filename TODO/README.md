You can upload screenshots in this folder or add comments on the todo section.



Suggestions and Todos
-----

- The two columns of posts under recent posts should be the same height
- "What I'm Doing?" should not end in a question mark, and is maybe more appropriately titled "About Me"
- The footer should contain the same links as the header (blog, github, linkedin, email)
- Add an "a" between the "in continuous loop" part of your short description about yourself.
- Link the clickable tags to the list of post.
- Perhaps add more user interactivity to your website.
- When you say "so I do more backend stuffs" the "stuffs" there is wrong and comes out as less professional. So instead you could say "more backend work"
- I have attached a screenshot for both cases in the folder.
