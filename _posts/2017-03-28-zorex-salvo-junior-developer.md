I'm from the Philippines.


I have been coding professionally for a year now.


I am a developer in a startup company and I am using Python/Django for most of the projects that I am doing.


Being exposed in the startup culture, I became fascinated with the whole tech community.


I attended hackathons, meetups, and summits since then.


Being a developer in a startup is both exciting and challenging. We got to try a lot of modern and trending technologies what we referred to as our *new toys*. But in exchange we have a lot of things to study. We have to be full-stack.
